<b><h3>Decision Tree Classifier for Diabetes Prediction</h3></b>
<b>Project Overview</b>

This repository contains a project where a decision tree classifier is built to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on their diagnostic measurements. The dataset used for this analysis is the Diabetes dataset from Kaggle, originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

<b>Dataset</b>

The dataset includes diagnostic measurements from female patients of Pima Indian heritage who are at least 21 years old. The goal is to predict the presence of diabetes based on various medical predictor variables. The dataset features several independent variables related to medical diagnostics and a single target variable, "Outcome," which indicates whether the patient has diabetes.

<b>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</b>

The data cleaning process involves:

- Handling missing values and duplicates.
- Normalizing or scaling features as needed.
- Encoding categorical variables if applicable.

<b>Decision Tree Classifier</b>

The decision tree classifier is used to:

- Train the model on the diabetes dataset.
- Evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Visualize the decision tree to understand how decisions are made based on the diagnostic measurements.

<b>Results</b>

The analysis provides insights into the effectiveness of the decision tree classifier in predicting diabetes. Key findings include:
- The accuracy of the model.
- The importance of different features in making predictions.
- Visual representation of the decision tree.
